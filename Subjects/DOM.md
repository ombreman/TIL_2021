### What is DOM?

The Document Object Model, or the “DOM”, is an interface to web pages. It is essentially an API to the page, allowing programs to read and manipulate the page’s content, structure, and styles.

The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
