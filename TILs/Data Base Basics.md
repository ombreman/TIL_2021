## What I learned Today

### Data Base
1. Relational : SQL => MySQL, postgreSQL, SQLite => strict
2. Non-Relational : NoSQL => mongoDB(Document DB), DynamoDB(from Amazon, KeyValue DB), couchDB => flexible, trendy atm

### SQL is easy to understand because it's similar to Spreadsheet and English.

ORM does change programing languages to SQL. i.e) sequelize
Devs depend on ORMs too much.
When ORM gets slow or speed is needed using SQL should be considered.

Recommended to use SQL first cause it can cover most of types of projects.
